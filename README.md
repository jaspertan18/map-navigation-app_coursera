# map-navigation-app_cousera
## Summary ##
1. Allows user to choose different types of search algorithms to perform map navigation which will result in different outcomes.
2. Implemented different kind of search algorithms including Breadth-First-Search, Dijkstra and A* Search.

## Snapshots ##
1. Red node markers indicates that the specific node was visited during algorithm run time.
2. It can be clearly seen that A* Search algorithm performs better than Breadth-First-Search algorithm.
